# Spotify Liked Songs (SLS)

A web application designed to help Spotify power-users bring order and advanced organization to their "Liked Songs" library and create dynamic playlists.

## üåü Purpose

For avid Spotify listeners who accumulate thousands of "Liked Songs" and constantly discover new music across genres, Spotify's native organization tools often fall short. It becomes challenging to quickly find specific types of music or to manage a vast and diverse collection effectively.

**Spotify Liked Songs (SLS)** addresses this by providing a layer of smart organization on top of your existing Spotify library. Instead of relying on a separate database, SLS intelligently uses Spotify's own playlist system and metadata (like playlist descriptions) to:

- Create and manage custom "category playlists" (e.g., "Country Vibes", "Workout Rap", "Chill Swedish Classics") directly within your Spotify account.
- Generate temporary "combination playlists" by mixing songs from different categories (e.g., "Country + Swedish Songs") which can be set to automatically expire.

This approach provides a powerful, flexible, and fully integrated music organization experience directly within your Spotify ecosystem.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Custom Category Playlists:** Transform your sprawling "Liked Songs" into clearly defined, user-managed category playlists on Spotify.
- **Dynamic Combination Playlists:** Create temporary playlists that blend multiple custom categories, perfect for specific moods or activities.
- **Seamless Spotify Integration:** All categorization and playlist generation happens directly within your Spotify account.
- **Secure Authentication:** Powered by Clerk for secure and easy login via Spotify.
- **No External Database:** All organizational logic and metadata are managed directly via Spotify's API and clever use of playlist properties (like descriptions).
